		<h2>Skipper Certification</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				In order to protect our equipment and our members, we have developed a strict skipper certification process.
				Each fleet has a unique and specific process, all of which are documented on this page.
				Each process is intended to ensure that only members who have demonstrated mastery of fleet-specific boat handling may take out crew or equipment.
				For a flowchart of all fleet certification processes, <a href="/documents/Qualification_Flowchart.pdf">click here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Vice Commodore maintains test administration, test results, and certification status.
				Contact the <a href="/contact#vice_commodore">Vice Commodore</a> for more information or to schedule a time to take a test.

		<h2>420 Certification</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				420 Certification is designed to be the first step for qualification in other fleets.
				There are two steps involved in becoming 420 qualified: a written test and an on-the-water test.
			</p>
			<p>
				The written test focuses on parts of the boat, right of way rules, and points of sail.
				After taking the written test, you may attempt the on-the-water test with a GTSC 420 instructor.
				The on-the-water test involves demonstrating the following skills:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Most important:</strong> Must be able to assess the conditions (wind, current, launch position, hazards) to determine whether you should go out based on your and your crew's skills and limitations
					</li>
					<li>Proper rigging (including knowledge of GTSC 420 equipment storage)</li>
					<li>Proper docking procedures</li>
					<li>Ability to skipper comfortably in moderate breeze (> 12 knots)</li>
					<li>Ability to confidently direct crew in their responsibilities</li>
					<li>Proper tacking and jibing</li>
					<li>Sailing at all points of sail</li>
					<li>Man overboard procedures</li>
					<li>Capsize recovery</li>
					<li>Proper de-rigging</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				After you pass the on-the-water test, your instructor will send a formal recommendation to the executive board.
				If exec approves, they will add 420 qualification to your GTSC Skipper card.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a 420 certified skipper, you may take up to 2 people out on the 420s and may attempt to become certified in other fleets.

		<h2>Keelboat Certification</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Keelboat Certification requires a much higher level of qualification to become a skipper.
				Like 420 certification, there is a written exam and a on-the-water test.
				The "Advanced Sailing" written exam covers the topics listed in the <a href="/documents/J24-certification/03_GTSC_J24_Certification_Requirements.pdf">Keel Certification Requirements</a> document;
				the on-the-water test covers the topics listed in the <a href="/documents/J24-certification/J24_On-the-water-test_Checklist.pdf">On the Water Test Checklist</a> document.
				The <a href="/contact#vice_commodore">Vice Commodore</a> may only administer the written exam once per semester&mdash;so don't mess up!
				The on-the-water test must be taken with a keelboat instructor in a J-24 with a spinnaker.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because the J-24 exams are so rigorous, there are two types of keelboat certification: intermediate and full.
			</p>
			<p>
				Intermediate skippers are those who have passed the "Advanced Sailing" exam, have participated in at least one instruction day with a keelboat skipper or instructor, and have received approval from a majority of exec.
				They need not have passed the on-the-water test.
				There are many restrictions on intermediate skippers compared to full skippers:
				<ul>
					<li>there must be at least 2 intermediate or full skippers on the boat to use it</li>
					<li>intermediate skippers must submit a "float plan" to exec prior to checking a boat out</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				To become fully keelboat certified, you must complete the same requirements as becoming intermediate certified in addition to passing the on-the-water test.
				As a fully certified keelboat skipper, you must:
				<ul>
					<li>notify exec when planning to use a keelboat. This notification should include who is expected to be present.</li>
					<li>promote the keelboat program by offering an open invitation sailing day</li>
					<li>help maintain the keelboats</li>
				</ul>
				Failure to meet any of these requirements is grounds for an executive vote to remove full skipper status.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both full and intermediate skippers must submit an updated <a href="/documents/J24-certification/02_GTSC_J24_Skipper_Application.pdf">Keelboat Skipper Application Form</a> to the <a href="/contact#vice_commodore">Vice Commodore</a> once per year to be reviewed by exec.

		<h2>Laser Certification</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Any 420-certified skipper may become Laser-certified if they pass an on-the-water test given by a Laser instructor.
				The on-the-water test is very similar to the 420 on-the-water test, except you will be sailing a Laser (duh).
				Upon passing the on-the-water test, your instructor will send a formal recommendation to the executive board.
				If exec approves, they will add Laser qualification to your skipper card.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a Laser certified skipper, you may:
				<ul>
					<li>use GTSC Lasers and related equipment without instructor supervision</li>
					<li>borrow GTSC Laser equipment and trailer for use at locations other than LLSC following notification and approval of the executive board</li>

			</p>
			<p>
				For the swim test, you must:
				<ul>
					<li>Swim 25 yards unassisted (without a lifejacket)</li>
					<li>Tread water for 5 minutes unassisted (without a lifejacket)</li>
					<li>Put a lifejacket on over your head while in the water</li>
