			It is every member's responsibility to call out other members who do not do so.
			The constitution may be amended by a 2/3 vote of the executive board and 2/3 vote of the general membership.
			Below are explanations of some important rules for general members.

				The <a href="/structure">executive board</a> consists of the Commodore, Vice Commodore, Treasurer, Race Team Captain, Secretary, Social Chair, and Fleet Captain.
				All of these people but the Fleet Captain are elected by the general membership to be responsible for the activities and operation of the club.
				The exec board can amend the <a href="/documents/Constitution_Bylaws.pdf">bylaws</a> with a majority vote.
				If the general membership disagrees with an exec decision, it may reverse it with a majority vote provided that a quorum of 1/3 of membership is present.

				If you have any questions about the club, <a href="/contact">contacting</a> the exec board is a good place to start!

		<h2>Lakehosts</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				We keep all our boats and equipment at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.llsc.com">Lake Lanier Sailing Club (LLSC)</a>.
				Only members of LLSC are allowed on the grounds, so GT Sailing holds 10 student memberships with them.
				Each year, our executive board appoints 10 students to receive our LLSC memberships.
				These 10 students are known as lakehosts.
			</p>
			<p>
				When appointing lakehosts, exec generally looks for students who are outgoing and actively involved in both sailing and maintaining our fleets.
				Lakehosts should be willing to take people up to the lake often and help them learn to sail.
				According to the <a href="/documents/Constitution_Bylaws.pdf">bylaws</a>, a lakehost must be:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>at least 420 or windsurf <a href="/certification">skipper certified</a>,</li>
				<li>a member of GTSC for at least two semesters,</li>
				<li>currently a member of GTSC,</li>
				<li>
					and either:
					<ul>
						<li>
							a student under 28 years old
						</li>
						<li>
							or a member of LLSC.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Nobody can be at LLSC unless they are a member or they are the guest of a member who is present.
				Since lakehosts are LLSC members, you can be at LLSC while they are also there.
				In addition, a lakehost must be present for anyone to use GTSC boats and equipment.
				The lakehost is in charge&mdash;while at LLSC, GTSC members must obey what they say.
			</p>
			<p>
				To become a lakehost, a student must be appointed by GTSC exec and must complete the <a href="/documents/LLSC_Member_Application.pdf" target="_blank">LLSC membership application form</a> and submit it to the current secretary of LLSC.

		<h2><a href="/certification">Skipper Certification</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				In order to protect our <a href="/fleet">equipment</a> and our members, we have developed a strict skipper certification process.
				Each fleet has a different process that is intended to ensure that only members who have demonstrated mastery of that boat may sail it.
				Once a member becomes skipper certified, they are allowed to skipper that kind of boat provided that a lakehost is present.
				For more information about the skipper certification process, <a href="/certification">click here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if you are not skipper certified, you can still go sailing!
				However, most of the time you will have to crew for someone who is skipper certified.
				The only exception is when there is an instructor present, in which case you are allowed to skipper as long as he/she is supervising you.
