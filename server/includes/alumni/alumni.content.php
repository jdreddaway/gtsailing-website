<h1>Alumni</h1>
<p>
  Welcome alumnus!
  To me, one of the coolest things about being an alumnus is watching the club that I had put so much effort into continue to grow and be successful.
  The best way to do this is to <a href="/contact#facebook">follow the GT Sailing club on social media</a>.
  In addition, you should join <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gt-sailing-alumni" target="_blank">the gt-sailing-alumni google group</a>
  to keep in touch with what the club is doing and to connect with other alumni.

  The <a href="/raceteam">race team</a> would really appreciate any assistance you could offer, be it housing at a regatta, coaching, or money for gas.
  Check out our <a href="/calendar">calendar</a> to see when/where our regattas are.
  <a href="/contact#race_captain">Contact the race team captain</a> if you would like to help out!

  Also, some fun pages to check out are the <a href="/history">history page</a> and the <a href="/history/past-execs">past-execs</a> page.
