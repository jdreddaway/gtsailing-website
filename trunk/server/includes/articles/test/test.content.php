	School is out for summer! Yippee!
	The weathered sailors of the GT Raceteam all go their separate ways.
	Some to Pennsylvania or Jersey to visit family; some to Chicago or Boston for internships; and still others to the Carribean to simply enjoy themselves.
	But there is still one thing that they all have in common: each is thinking about sailing.

	The team finished 8th at the SAISA Spring Championship&mdash;only 2 points out of 6th, which would have qualified them for semi-finals at St. Mary's College.
	Slightly disappointed, they were warmed by the knowledge that GT Sailing is going to kick ass next year.
	Since the team is fairly young, it will not lose any serious raceteam members (although a sincere shoutout to Danny Rodriguez, Matt Salley, and Abhay Baliga is well deserved).
	In addition, hopes are high for the incoming team in the fall.
	Not only will super-sailor Martin Kendrick be returing from his semester off, but there are also rumors of talented high school sailors coming to Tech.
	Only time will tell, but be warned: someone needs to keep an eye on that GT Sailing Raceteam.
