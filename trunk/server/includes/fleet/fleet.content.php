				A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J/24" target="_blank">J/24</a> is a 24-foot keelboat that can take 2 to 6 people out on the water.

				Georgia Tech's J/24s are docked at LLSC's wet slips, which means that they are very easy to take out sailing.
				However, there must be either at least one fully J/24 certified skipper or at least two intermediate J/24 certified skippers on board.
