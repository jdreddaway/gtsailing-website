# Getting the Files on Your Computer #

## Introduction ##

The project files are stored in a system called [subversion (SVN)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion). I like to use a subversion client called [TortoiseSVN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TortoiseSVN) to checkout/update/commit files. Below are the steps you should follow to get the files on your computer.

## What to Do ##

  1. Install TortoiseSVN by following these [instructions](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/TortoiseSVN%20instructions#InstallingTortoiseSVN).
  1. Click [here](https://code.google.com/p/gtsailing-website/source/checkout) for information about how to checkout the gtsailing-website project.
  1. Create a new folder on your computer where you would like the website to be located.
  1. Right-click the folder and select "SVN Checkout..."
  1. In the "URL of Repository" box, enter the url from Google Code.
  1. Do not change any of the other options. Click OK.
  1. You will be prompted for a username and password. Your username is your gmail address, but your password is not your gmail password. The password is automatically generated for you. Click [here](https://code.google.com/hosting/settings) to see what it is.
