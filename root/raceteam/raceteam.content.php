		<h2>School Funding</h2>
		<p>
			As far as traveling to regattas goes, Georgia Tech only funds 2/3 of the gas for 4 regattas every year.
			This means that the sailors who go to the event have to split gas, vehicle rental, and hotel expenses.
			Fortunately, the CRC has SUVs and 12 passenger vans that we can rent for only $35 per day.
			We also have a lot of amazing alumni and friends who let us stay at their houses for free.
