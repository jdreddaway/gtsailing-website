	        <h3>Windsurf Qualification</h3>
	        <p class="style4">There are three steps involved in becoming windsurf qualified at GTSC: a written test, an on-the-water test, and a swim test. After passing these three tests, your instructor will send a formal recommendation to the executive board. If exec approves, you will be a windsurf qualified skipper. The end result of this process is that, as a windsurf qualified skipper, you may enjoy the priviledges described below and exec will add windsurf qualification to your GTSC Skipper card. </p>
	        <p class="style4">Windsurf qualified members of the club enjoy the following priviledges: </p>
	        <ul>
	          <li>May use windsurf equipment without instructor supervision</li>
              <li> May borrow windsurf equipment for use at locations other than LLSC following notification and approval of the executive board </li>
              <li>May use personal discretion to decide whether or not to use a lifejacket while windsurfing. <br />
                <strong>Note:</strong> All non-windsurf qualified members <strong>are required to wear lifejackets</strong> while using GTSC windsurf equipment.</li>
      </ul>
	    <h2 class="style2">The Written Test:</h2>
	        <p>The windsurf written test is provided by US Sailing and may be accessed online <a href="http://www.windsurfing.sailingcourse.com/windsurfing_test.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. If you take the test online, please print out a copy of the certificate you receive when you pass and bring it to exec during one of our regular weekly meetings. You may take a written version of the test any Thursday before our weekly meeting. If you would like to do this, please contact the Vice-Commodore in advance to make arrangements.</p>
	        <h2 class="style2">	The On-The-Water Test:</h2>
	        <p>The on-the-water test involves demonstrating the following skills for a windsurf instructor:</p>
	        <ul>
	          <li><strong>Most important</strong>: Must be able to assess the conditions (wind, current, launch position, hazards) to determine whether you should go out, and if so, what size sail you should use based on your own skills and limitations. </li>
            </ul><ul>  
			  <li>Proper rigging (including knowledge of GTSC windsurf equipment storage)</li>
              <li> Comfort maintaining the basic position</li>
              <li>Proper steering (in particular, ability to go up &amp; down wind)</li>
              <li> Points of sail</li>
              <li>Proper tacking and jibing</li>
              <li>Proper de-rigging (Note: Never de-rig on the sand. Always wash equipment with fresh water and allow sails to dry completely before putting away.) </li>
      </ul>
	        <h2 class="style2">The Swim Test:</h2>
	        <p>The swim test involves demonstrating the following physical skills for a windsurf instructor:</p>
	        <ul>
	          <li>Swim 25 yards  unassisted (without a lifejacket)</li>
              <li> Tread water for 5 minutes unassisted (without a lifejacket)</li>
              <li>Put a lifejacket on over your head while in the water </li>
