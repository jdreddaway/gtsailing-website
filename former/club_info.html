	        <p class="style4">The Georgia Tech Sailing Club was founded in 1961 by a group of students who discovered they had a common interest in sailing and racing. They wanted to encourage other students to take up their passion for sailing and began teaching everyone who wanted to learn. Over the years, the number of avid sailors at Georgia Tech has grown. We have accumulated  an extensive fleet of different sailboats and watercraft. Throughout this expansion, we have maintained our emphasis on racing through participation in intercollegiate and local racing circuits and maintained our passion for instruction through the Options Program at Georgia Tech. This sport is one of the most fun and exciting in the world, and we are proud to be an active part of the sailing community. </p>
	        <h3>Meeting Information</h3>
	        <p class="style4">We meet every Thursday from 7:30 to 8:00pm. These meetings are located in room 251 of the Georgia Tech 
			Campus Recreation Center (CRC). To find the CRC, look for it on the <A href="http://gtalumni.org/map/" target="_blank">GT campus map</A>. 
			All members and anyone interested in the club are welcome at these meetings.</p>
	        <h3>Lakehosts</h3>
			<p class="style4">We keep all our boats and equipment at the Lake Lanier Sailing Club (LLSC). Only 
			members of LLSC are allowed on the grounds so we hold 10 student memberships with LLSC. Each year, our executive board appoints 10 students to 
			receive our LLSC memberships. These 10 students are known as <A href="contacts.html#Lakehosts">lakehosts</A>. In order for any of our members to 
			use our equipment (or be at LLSC for any other reason), a lakehost must be present to accompany them.</p>
			<p class="style4">When appointing lakehosts, exec generally looks for students who are outgoing and actively involved in both sailing and maintaining 
			our fleets. In addition, a lakehost should be at least 420 or windsurf <A href="qualification.html">skipper qualified</A>, a member of GTSC for at least 
			one year, and plan on being a member of GTSC for at least one more year.</P>
			<p class="style4">To become a lakehost, a student must be appointed by GTSC exec and must complete 
			the <A href="documents/LLSC_Member_Application.pdf" target="_blank">LLSC membership application form</A> and submit it to the current secretary of LLSC.</p>
	        <h3>Dues and other Membership Costs</h3>
			<P>All GTSC members must pay dues either every semester or every year. The following table is a breakdown of the membership fees:</P>
