			  <P><I>Click <A href="documents/Constitution_Bylaws.pdf" target="_blank">here</A> to view or download the pdf version of this document.</I></P>
			</div>
			
			<div><P>Article I -- Name</P></div>
			<div><P>The name of this organization is the Georgia Tech Sailing Club.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>Article II -- Purpose</P></div>
			<div><P>The purpose of this club is to encourage sailing, teach sailing and promote racing to all members of the Georgia Tech community. 
			The Club will provide boats and facilities for recreational sailing, host regattas, and teach members to sail. The Club will sponsor 
			recreational events at Lake Lanier and sailing trips to other waters.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>Article III -- Membership</P></div>
			<div><P>The following rules about membership and Lake Hosts are made to help the Georgia Tech Sailing Club avaoid Lake Lanier Sailing Club 
			membership problems.</P>
			<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Active membership of the Georgia Tech Sailing Club is divided into two categories:<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular members, who are undergraduate students, graduate students, 
			faculty, staff,<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or anyone else associated with Georgia Tech who has a current, valid Georgia Tech ID.<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, former students may be regular members for one semester after<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they graduate.<br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associate members, who must be members of the Lake Lanier Sailing Club.</P>
			<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;A qualified person becomes a member by paying dues. This must be done before the member checks out a boat or windsurfer. 
			People who regularly sail with the Club but do not check out boats should pay dues (unless they are a guest, Bylaws, section 7).</P>
			<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of dues is set in the bylaws. Dues may be paid by the year, if desired. Changes in dues must be approved by
			two-thirds of the Executive Committee and by a majority of the members at a regular meeting (excluding summer semester).</P>
			<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dues are not refundable except possibly in the case of revoked membership (see Article III, section 6).</P>
			<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Executive Committee shall assess any member for damages to property owned or controlled by the Georgia Tech Sailing
			Club, which is caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of that member. If a member does not follow the directions of the Lake Host or an
			officer of the Club, any resulting damage will be considered to be an act of willful misconduct.</P>
			<P>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership may be suspended or revoked at any time by a two-thirds vote of the Executive Committee. The
			membership may overturn this decision with a 2/3 vote.</P>
			<P>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Boat check-out privileges, maintenance duties, and other privileges and duties of the Membership are set forth in the Bylaws.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>Article IV -- Officers and Executive Committee</P></div>
			<div><P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The officers of the Club are the Commodore, Vice-Commodore, Treasurer, and Secretary. The Executive Committee is made up
			of the four officers, and of those people who are appointed to Executive Committee, in accordance with the bylaws.</P>
			<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elections -- The order of election of the officers of the Club is: Commodore, Vice-Commodore, Treasurer, and Secretary. 
			Officers will be elected at the end of spring semester. It is the responsibility of the Executive Committee to ensure that there is at least one 
			eligible candidate nominated for each office. Nominations may be made from the floor at any time. During the elections meeting, if a candidate is
			not elected to an office, that candidate may be nominated to another office. The membership shall be informed of nomination procedures several 
			weeks before the election and the week of the election. All officers must be full-time students or in-town co-op students. If an officer graduates 
			or no longer can fulfill the duties of office, an election is held for just that office. Summer (interim) officers are appointed by that officer 
			and approved by the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>The elections will be conducted as follows: A club member who has not been nominated for an elected position shall be appointed as the 
			Moderator, in advance, by the Executive Committee. The Club is reminded that only members may vote. The voting is done by secret ballot, on an 
			office-by-office basis. Before the vote, the duties of the officer are read. Each candidate gives a speech. After all of the speeches for that 
			office are made, the candidates may be questioned by any club member or the faculty advisor. The Moderator shall then distribute one ballot to each 
			eligible voter and oversee the subsequent collection and counting. If no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, a runoff election will be 
			held between the two candidates who received the most votes. In the event of more than one tie, the current Executive Committee shall vote by 
			secret ballot to determine the winner. There must be a quorum of members, as defined in Article V, Section One, for the elections to be held.</P>
			<P>After the election meeting, the new and old Executive Committee will meet. At this meeting, a Bank Resolution form will be filled out, 
			transferring the Wachovia account to the new Treasurer (This form is available from Wachovia). The outgoing Secretary provides the new Secretary 
			with electronic files containing the text of the constitution and bylaws. Other club records are turned over to the appropriate officers. The next 
			week, the outgoing officers preside at the banquet, and at the banquet ceremonially turn over the Club to the new officers.</P>
			<P>Officers may be removed from office by a two-thirds vote of the Executive Committee and of the regular members at a meeting one week after 
			the Executive Committee has notified the Club of removal proceedings, or by a three-fourths vote of regular members without any action from 
			the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties of officers</P>
			<P>All officers are responsible for the activities and operations of the Club. All officers must be members of the sailing club (must have 
			paid dues). Officers shall attend all executive committee meetings. If an officer cannot attend, the officer should inform the Commodore. 
			If an officer cannot attend at least 75% of the meetings, that officer should resign or <u>may</u> be impeached. If an officer is temporarily 
			unable to fulfill the duties of the office, that officer may appoint someone to temporarily fill the office. The Executive Committee 
			approves the temporary officer.</P>
			<P>Commodore --- The Commodore is responsible for the overall guidance and direction of the Club. The Commodore represents the Club at 
			appropriate councils and meetings or appoints a representative to do so. The Commodore is entrusted with the administration of the Club, 
			and will preside at all general meetings and Executive Committee meetings, enforce all rules, and carry out the will of the membership. The
			Commodore will ensure that any matter which needs to be decided upon by Executive Committee is brought up, as well as any other matter which 
			a member believes needs to be decided upon. The Commodore must make sure that all officers are doing their job, and if not, is obligated to 
			begin removal proceedings. All contracts are signed by the Commodore. All skipper’s cards are signed by the Commodore and the approved 
			on-the-water instructor. The Commodore appoints committee chairmen. The Commodore is responsible for keeping the Club facilities clean 
			and maintained.</P>
			<P>Vice-Commodore --- The Vice-Commodore must take on the duties of the Commodore in the event that the
Commodore temporarily cannot fulfill those duties. If the Commodore is absent from a meeting the Vice-
Commodore will preside. The Vice-Commodore is in charge of the instructional program and the testing
program. The Vice-Commodore may appoint members to help in giving the written test. The Vice-
Commodore may also appoint instructors (regular instructors or windsurfer instructors) to give on-thewater
tests. The appointments must be ratified by a majority vote of the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>Treasurer --- The Treasurer administers the financial affairs of the Club, collecting dues, issuing
reimbursements for authorized expenses, submitting bills to the CRC, and submitting receipts to the CRC.
The Treasurer acts according to the fiscal policies set forth in the constitution and bylaws, and ensures that
expenditures of the Club match the allocations of the Executive Committee and Club. The Treasurer
prepares a budget to submit to SGA. A list of paid membership is kept up-to-date by the Treasurer,
available to the Lake Hosts.</P>
			<P>Secretary --- The Secretary records the minutes for the Executive Committee and Club meetings. These
minutes form a record of the decisions, policies, and financial allocations of the Club. The Secretary
informs the membership of the decisions of Executive Committee, provides a copy of the minutes to
anyone who wants them, and keeps the membership “up-to-date” with a newsletter. The Secretary is
responsible for Club publicity, Technique advertisements, flyers, and membership campaigns. The
Secretary maintains a membership roster, and handles liability waiver forms. The Secretary maintains a
current copy of the constitution and bylaws, and posts a copy of the constitution and bylaws where any
member can refer to them.</P>
			<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet Captain</P>
			<P>The Fleet Captain is appointed by the Executive Committee. The Fleet Captain holds office until new
officers are elected, or until removed by a 2/3 vote of the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>Duties of Fleet Captain:</P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fleet Captain enforces boat checkout procedures as established by the<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fleet Captain is aware of the maintenance status of all of the boats.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fleet Captain takes care of boat and trailer registration.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>Article V -- Amendments and decision-making</P></div>
			<div><P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;The general membership is the ultimate decision making body, and can reverse Executive Committee
decisions. Decisions are made by majority vote. A quorum is 1/3 of the membership (members who have
paid dues).</P>
			<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the Club’s governance is carried out by the Executive Committee. Decisions are made by
majority vote, and a quorum is more than half of the voting members. One person may only have one vote,
except in the case of a tie. In this case, the Commodore has a tie-breaking vote. The Executive Committee
may not vote special privileges to itself, such as parties or trips. Any member may ask to be on the agenda
and present an issue to Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bylaws may be amended by a majority vote of Executive Committee. The membership is promptly
informed of bylaw changes.</P>
			<P>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;The constitution may be amended by a 2/3 vote of the executive committee, followed by a 2/3 vote of
the general membership.</P>
			<P>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Skipper’s cards are approved by Executive Committee. Instructors which are appointed by the Vice-
Commodore are approved by the Executive Committee. Committee heads which are appointed by the
Commodore are approved by the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
		
			<div><P>Article VI -- Meetings</P></div>
			<div><P>Meetings of the GTSC will be held at least 4 times a semester. If the Club does not hold meetings, or the
membership falls below 12 members for 3 semesters in a row, the Club will be considered inactive and
disbanded. In this event, all assets and boats are transferred to the GT YMCA until the Club is restarted.
The boats which belong to the Georgia Tech Alumni Association are held by the Alumni Association.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>Article VII -- Fiscal responsibility</P></div>
			<div><P>To demonstrate that sound financial practices are being followed by the Executive Committee, the books of
the Club will be audited every semester by a club member, the Commodore, and the Club’s advisor. The
results of the audit will be reported to the Club. The procedures for this audit are set forth in the Bylaws,
section 8.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>Article VIII -- Affiliation</P></div>
			<div><P>The GTSC is affiliated with the LLSC through the purchase of 10 student memberships. The GTSC
Commodore is in regular contact with the LLSC Commodore, or with a liaison to the LLSC Board of
Governors.</P>
			<P>The GTSC is a member of the GT YMCA. This membership provides 501(3)(c) status, and provides for

			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial Policies</P></div>
			<div><P>8.1 Dues Policy<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Students- Dues are $50 for spring and fall semesters. $40 for summer semester.<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faculty/Staff- Dues are $80 for spring and fall semesters. $60 for summer semester.<BR />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Associate Members- Dues are $80 for spring and fall semesters. $60 for summer semester.</P>
			<P>8.2 Receipts for boat repairs or club authorized expenditures can’t be submitted in place of dues. This
simplifies and clarifies bookkeeping. A receipt will be written for any money received by the Club.</P>
			<P>8.3 The Club’s finances are divided among three accounts: a checking account (Wachovia account), a
Sports Club Account (SGA monies), and a YMCA account (interest bearing savings). If the balance in the
Wachovia checking account is $1500 or greater for more than a week, the treasurer will send a check to the
YMCA savings account to bring the balance in the Wachovia account below $1200.</P>
			<P>8.4 Internal audit procedure: An internal audit will be made once a semester to check for bookkeeping
errors and to ensure that financial policies are being followed. This audit will determine that:
1) Each reimbursement check is matched by a receipt for supplies or by a bill.
2) Reimbursement checks reflect what was authorized by the Executive Committee.
3) Deposit records for all accounts match club income (from dues, sale of boats, and other income).
The procedure for this internal audit is:</P>
			<P class="indent">1) The audit of the financial records will be done once per semester, during the first or second week of
school. The final audit will be done just before elections. Nominees for Treasurer are encouraged to attend
the audit.<BR />
2) If receipts are turned into CRC for reimbursement to the operating expenses accounts before the
semester audit, the receipts will be photocopied, so they can be included in the audit.<BR />
3) The audit committee will be composed of one student club member who is not a member of the voting
Executive Committee, the Commodore and the YMCA advisor.<BR />
4) The audit committee will report it’s findings to the general membership at the next meeting, and place a
copy of the report in the minutes.</P>
			<P>8.5 All expenses less than $30 will be reimbursed if prior authorized by one member of the Executive
Committee. Expenses of more than this amount require approval by a majority of the Executive
Committee. No person should expect to be reimbursed for expenses that did not receive prior authorization
from the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>8.6 The YMCA advisor is on the Wachovia account.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Racing</P></div>
			<div><P>9.1 The racing team is composed of sailing club members who wish to be on the racing team. These team
members must be members of GTSC and undergraduates at Georgia Tech.</P>
			<P>9.2 The racing team captain is elected by a majority vote of the team members on the night of the General
GTSC elections. Team members are eligible to vote or run for the Captain position if they have paid dues
for the current semester and competed in at least one college regatta during either of the two most recent
seasons.</P>
			<P>9.3 The racing team sends a voting representative to Executive Committee. This representative is the Team
Captain unless the captain already has a vote on Executive Committee. In this case, another person will be
elected by the racing team as their voting representative in all Executive Committee decisions. The voting
delegate from the racing team must be approved by the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleet Captain</P></div>
			<div><P>The appointed Fleet Captain shall receive one vote on the Executive Committee.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;Membership and Voting</P></div>
			<div><P>11.1 Membership in Georgia Tech Sports Clubs is defined by the University and limited to all current
undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in six or more credit hours, full time co-op students, and
faculty or staff of the institute.</P>
			<P>11.2 GTSC decision making processes will be governed in accordance with SGA policy. Only current
students (as defined in section 11.1) may vote in club elections or run for Executive office. Students who
have recently graduated or are taking a semester off from course work may still serve on the summer
semester Executive Board if they meet the requirements set forth in Article IV of the Constitution.</P>
			<P>&nbsp;</P></div>
			
			<div><P>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Institute Policy</P></div>
			<div><P>Rules and guidelines for Sports Clubs set forth by the Georgia Institute of Technology Dean of Students,
the Student Government Association, and Campus Recreation Center take precedent over the GTSC
Constitution and Bylaws.</P>
