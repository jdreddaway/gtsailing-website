		<h2>Club Team</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				We are a completely student-run club team&mdash;
				we plan our practices, trips, and regattas ourselves.
				We do not have a coach.
				We do not get free housing or meal plans or scholarships for sailing.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>But that does not hold us back. We are one helluva team.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				We are still fairly competitive against other Varsity teams, and we know how to have a lot more fun than them.
				All we have is each other, and that makes us a pretty close-knit group.
				Personally, my best friends are the ones I sail with every weekend.

			<h2>School Funding</h2>
			<p>
				As far as traveling to regattas goes, Georgia Tech only funds 2/3 of the gas for 4 regattas every year.
				This means that the sailors who go to the event have to split gas, vehicle rental, and hotel expenses.
				Fortunately, the CRC has SUVs and 12 passenger vans that we can rent for only $35 per day.
				We also have a lot of amazing alumni and friends who let us stay at their houses for free.
